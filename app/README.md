# Exercise 02.01 - Using Kotlin coroutines

Create an application that will display two input fields one text field, and a button. 
The input fields will be limited to numbers only, and when the user presses the button, then
the text field will display the sum of the two numbers after 5 seconds. 
The sum and waiting will be implemented using coroutines.
